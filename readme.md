<h1> Introduction to Python </h1>
What is Python?
A high-level language, used in web development, data science, automation, AI, and more.

Known for its readability, which means code is easier to write, understand, and maintain.

Backed by library support, so you don’t have to build everything from scratch; there’s probably a library that already does what you need.
